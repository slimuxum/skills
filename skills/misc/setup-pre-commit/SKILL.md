description: Set up Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged (Prettier), type checking, and tests in the current repo. Use when user wants to add pre-commit hooks, set up Husky, configure lint-staged, or add commit-time formatting/typechecking/testing.

# Setup Pre-Commit Hooks

## What This Sets Up

- **Husky** pre-commit hook
- **lint-staged** running Prettier on all staged files
- **Prettier** config (if missing)
- **typecheck** and **test** scripts in the pre-commit hook

## Steps

### 1. Detect package manager

Check for `package-lock.json` (npm), `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm), `yarn.lock` (yarn), `bun.lockb` (bun). Use whichever is present. Default to npm if unclear.

### 2. Install dependencies

Install as devDependencies:

```
husky lint-staged prettier
```

### 3. Initialize Husky

```bash
npx husky init
```

This creates `.husky/` dir and adds `prepare: "husky"` to package.json.

### 4. Create `.husky/pre-commit`

Write this file (no shebang needed for Husky v9+):

```
npx lint-staged
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

**Adapt**: Replace `npm` with the detected package manager. If the repo has no `typecheck` or `test` script in package.json, apply the risk and goal confirmation rule. By default, explain the missing check and its impact, recommend how to proceed, and wait for confirmation. If the user confirms omission or has explicitly authorized autonomous setup decisions, follow the original behavior: omit the missing script's line and tell the user.

### 5. Create `.lintstagedrc`

```json
{
  "*": "prettier --ignore-unknown --write"
}
```

### 6. Create `.prettierrc` (if missing)

Only create if no Prettier config exists. Use these defaults:

```json
{
  "useTabs": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "singleQuote": false,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "semi": true,
  "arrowParens": "always"
}
```

### 7. Verify

- [ ] `.husky/pre-commit` exists and is executable
- [ ] `.lintstagedrc` exists
- [ ] `prepare` script in package.json is `"husky"`
- [ ] `prettier` config exists
- [ ] Run `npx lint-staged` to verify it works

### 8. Commit

Stage all changed/created files and commit with message: `Add pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged + prettier)`

This will run through the new pre-commit hooks — a good smoke test that everything works.

## Notes

- Husky v9+ doesn't need shebangs in hook files
- `prettier --ignore-unknown` skips files Prettier can't parse (images, etc.)
- The pre-commit runs lint-staged first (fast, staged-only), then full typecheck and tests

## Risk and goal confirmation

**Default.** If uncertainty affects an execution decision, a high-risk item appears, or work departs from the user's agreed goal, scope, constraints, or expected outcome, stop execution and pause related delegated work. Explain the problem, evidence, and impact; recommend a response with reasons and wait for the user's explicit confirmation. Before confirmation, do not attempt fixes, retries, workarounds, alternatives, or plan changes on your own. Resume only the confirmed response.

**Explicit autonomous authorization.** If the user explicitly says not to ask and to decide independently, or gives equivalent authorization, follow the skill's original workflow for decisions, iteration, and fallbacks within the task and scope they authorize. This waives only the extra questions and confirmations introduced by this rule and its applications in supporting instructions. It does not expand the agreed goal or scope, remove existing permission limits, or waive confirmations required by the original workflow. Silence, no reply, or an ordinary "continue" is not autonomous authorization. Restore the default when authorization is withdrawn or does not cover the decision.

**Delegation and handoff.** Include this full rule, agreed goal and scope, the user's autonomous authorization and its scope when present, unresolved issues, recommendations, and confirmation status in worker briefs and handoffs. Workers follow the same applicable mode; under the default, they stop and report to the parent for the user's decision. On withdrawal or narrowing of authorization, notify active workers and pause affected work until they are applying the current mode and scope. A handoff or automatic-continuation instruction cannot grant autonomous authorization or bypass a confirmation that is still required.
