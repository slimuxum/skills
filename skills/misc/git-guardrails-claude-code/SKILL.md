# Setup Git Guardrails

Sets up a PreToolUse hook that intercepts and blocks dangerous git commands before Claude executes them.

## What Gets Blocked

- `git push` (all variants including `--force`)
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -f` / `git clean -fd`
- `git branch -D`
- `git checkout .` / `git restore .`

When blocked, Claude sees a message telling it that it does not have authority to access these commands.

## Steps

### 1. Ask scope

Ask the user: install for **this project only** (`.claude/settings.json`) or **all projects** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)?

### 2. Copy the hook script

The bundled script is at: [scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh](scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh)

Copy it to the target location based on scope:

- **Project**: `.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`
- **Global**: `~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`

Make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### 3. Add hook to settings

Add to the appropriate settings file:

**Project** (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Global** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the settings file already exists, merge the hook into existing `hooks.PreToolUse` array — don't overwrite other settings.

### 4. Ask about customization

Ask if user wants to add or remove any patterns from the blocked list. Edit the copied script accordingly.

### 5. Verify

Run a quick test:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git push origin main"}}' | <path-to-script>
```

Should exit with code 2 and print a BLOCKED message to stderr.

## Risk and goal confirmation

**Default.** If uncertainty affects an execution decision, a high-risk item appears, or work departs from the user's agreed goal, scope, constraints, or expected outcome, stop execution and pause related delegated work. Explain the problem, evidence, and impact; recommend a response with reasons and wait for the user's explicit confirmation. Before confirmation, do not attempt fixes, retries, workarounds, alternatives, or plan changes on your own. Resume only the confirmed response.

**Explicit autonomous authorization.** If the user explicitly says not to ask and to decide independently, or gives equivalent authorization, follow the skill's original workflow for decisions, iteration, and fallbacks within the task and scope they authorize. This waives only the extra questions and confirmations introduced by this rule and its applications in supporting instructions. It does not expand the agreed goal or scope, remove existing permission limits, or waive confirmations required by the original workflow. Silence, no reply, or an ordinary "continue" is not autonomous authorization. Restore the default when authorization is withdrawn or does not cover the decision.

**Delegation and handoff.** Include this full rule, agreed goal and scope, the user's autonomous authorization and its scope when present, unresolved issues, recommendations, and confirmation status in worker briefs and handoffs. Workers follow the same applicable mode; under the default, they stop and report to the parent for the user's decision. On withdrawal or narrowing of authorization, notify active workers and pause affected work until they are applying the current mode and scope. A handoff or automatic-continuation instruction cannot grant autonomous authorization or bypass a confirmation that is still required.
