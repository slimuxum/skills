# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for the configured repositories or Logical Context live as GitHub issues. Record the explicit `<owner/repo>` for every tracker target and pass it to every command.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..." --body "..."`. Use `--body-file -` with approved stdin for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --add-label "..."` / `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --remove-label "..."`
- **List available labels**: `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comment "..."`

Do not infer the tracker repository from the current directory or a Git remote. In a multi-repository scope, code and tracker ownership may differ. Keep `--repo <owner/repo>` on every issue, label, and PR command, and use an explicit repository in every API path.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: query the explicit repository through `gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls?state=open' --jq '[.[] | select(.author_association == "CONTRIBUTOR" or .author_association == "FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR" or .author_association == "NONE")]'`. The REST field is `author_association`; `gh pr list --json` does not expose it.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "..."`, `gh pr edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --add-label "..."` / `gh pr edit <number> --repo <owner/repo> --remove-label "..."`, and `gh pr close <number> --repo <owner/repo>`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42 --repo <owner/repo>` and fall back to `gh issue view 42 --repo <owner/repo>`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies** — the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only — the live gate). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`, or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --repo <owner/repo> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: run `gh issue comment <n> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n> --repo <owner/repo>`, and append the map pointer in that same repository.
