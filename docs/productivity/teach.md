## What it does

`teach` treats the current directory, or another root you explicitly name, as a standing teaching workspace and teaches you one topic across many [sessions](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session), in short self-contained HTML lessons.

It does not teach from what the [model](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/model) already knows. [Parametric knowledge](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/parametric-knowledge) is treated as untrusted: before it teaches, it goes and finds high-trust resources, records them in `RESOURCES.md`, and cites them inside every lesson. The other structural fact is that it is [stateful](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/stateful) — the mission, the resources, the lessons and the record of what you have learned all live in the directory as files, so the next session picks up from those files rather than from whatever is left of the last conversation.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/teach` — the [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it when the learning is the project: a language, a framework, a codebase you have just joined, yoga, shaders, a certification. It is not the tool for one explanation in passing.

| What you want | What to reach for |
| --- | --- |
| To learn a topic over weeks, with sessions that accumulate | `teach` |
| One idea explained inside the session you are already in | Just ask, in that session |
| The agent's last message re-pitched because it didn't land | [wait-what](https://aihero.dev/skills-wait-what) |
| To sharpen thinking you already have, rather than acquire new material | [grill-me](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-me) |
| A background agent to read [primary sources](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/primary-source) and leave you a cited document | [research](https://aihero.dev/skills-research) |
| To learn something that came up mid-grilling, without derailing the [grilling](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/grilling) | [handoff](https://aihero.dev/skills-handoff) out to a teaching workspace, then `teach` there |

## Prerequisites

`teach` builds a directory rather than producing a file, and the skill assumes one mission per workspace — so confirm a directory you are happy to give over to a single topic before it writes. The skill treats only that directory as writable; it does not infer the destination from its install path, the current repository or whichever directory happens to be active. A separate repository is often a useful home when a team wants to version and share the lessons.

What accumulates in that directory:

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `MISSION.md` | Why you are learning this. Everything else hangs off it; if it is missing, the first thing `teach` does is interview you until it isn't |
| `RESOURCES.md` | The vetted sources it teaches from, split into Knowledge and Wisdom (communities) |
| `lessons/*.html` | The numbered HTML lessons — the primary unit of teaching |
| `reference/*.html` | Compressed, printable cheat-sheets, algorithms and glossaries: the documents you actually return to |
| `learning-records/*.md` | ADR-style notes on what you have demonstrably learned, used to decide what to teach next |
| `assets/*` | Reusable stylesheets, quiz widgets, simulators and diagram helpers |
| `NOTES.md` | Your stated teaching preferences |

A glossary suits most topics, but the skill ships a `GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md` that `SKILL.md` no longer links to, so you will only get one if you ask ([issue #559](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/issues/559)). The teaching root keeps that skill-owned reference separate from learner-owned artifacts.

## Storage strength, not fluency

The word to think with is **storage strength**: long-term retention, as opposed to **fluency**, the in-the-moment recall that feels like mastery while you are reading and is gone a week later. `teach` builds the former through desirable difficulty — retrieval practice, spacing, interleaving. Knowledge comes first, where difficulty is the enemy because it eats the working memory you need in order to understand; then the skill is drilled through a tight feedback loop, where difficulty is the tool.

Two things steer what you get taught. The **mission** — the concrete real-world reason you want this — grounds every lesson; without it the lessons drift abstract and nothing decides what comes next. From the mission and the learning records, `teach` picks the next lesson inside your **zone of proximal development**: challenging enough to take effort, not so far ahead that it stops being learnable.

It is also why the skill pushes back rather than obliges. A question that needs **wisdom** — real-world judgement — gets an attempted answer and then a pointer to a community where you can test it. A quiz is a gate, not a formality: one user reported saying "thanks a lot" and being told the drill was still live.

## Lessons, references and components

A **lesson** is one self-contained HTML file, short enough to finish in a sitting, tied to the mission, giving one tangible win. It cites its sources, recommends one primary source to go and read yourself, and links to sibling lessons and reference documents. When a source is a workspace artifact, the citation identifies its repository, path or subtree, and source revision rather than relying on the current directory.

The split worth knowing: lessons are rarely revisited, reference documents are. So the compressed essence of a lesson — the syntax table, the algorithm, the pose sequence, the glossary — belongs in `reference/`, not buried in the lesson that introduced it.

Lessons are built from reusable **components** in `assets/`: stylesheets, quiz widgets, simulators and diagram helpers. Reuse is the default. The first component is a shared stylesheet linked by every lesson so the course stays visually consistent.

## Common questions

**Where does it put the files?**
At the current-directory teaching workspace, unless you explicitly named another root. Skill-owned format references still live beside `SKILL.md`; learner-owned lessons, references, records and assets live only under the teaching root. The Skill's own install directory is never used as the learner workspace.

**Do I stay in one session, or start a new one per lesson?**
All three approaches work — staying in the same session, re-invoking `/teach` in a new session, or opening a new session in the same folder. Each lesson is its own invocation. The folder is the continuity, not the conversation. Common practice is to open a fresh session in the workspace and say `/teach next lesson for <topic>`.

**How do I know it isn't teaching me something it made up?**
You don't, on the skill's word alone. You read the primary sources. `teach` is not reliable enough to trust unchecked, and no skill built on an LLM is. The grounding machinery — `RESOURCES.md`, citations in every lesson, one recommended primary source per lesson — exists to make verification cheap, not to remove the need for it. The failure is not hypothetical: one user learning a 2x2 Rubik's cube was given fabricated move sequences that don't solve it. The diagnostic checklist for a case like that is model, harness, effort — and what the source was. Risk is highest in procedural domains with precise notation, and lowest where the output is immediately verifiable, like code you can run.

**The correct quiz answer is always the first option.**
Confirmed by several people, on Sonnet, on Opus and on GLM, and still unfixed. `SKILL.md` now requires every answer to be the same number of words, which kills a different tell — the correct answer used to be the only fully-reasoned one — but says nothing about position. One contributor tested an instruction-level fix for position and reported the correct answer still landing in slot A 33 times out of 33 across nine lessons ([#335](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/issues/335)), which points at a shuffling quiz component in `assets/` as the real fix rather than better wording. Until that ships, treat answer position as meaningless. Your `assets/` directory is yours to change, so asking for a component that shuffles at render time is a legitimate local fix.

**It assumed I already knew things, and used terms it never defined.**
The commonest substantive complaint. There is no assessment step: `teach` infers your level from the mission and the learning records, and in session one there are no learning records. One user running it inside a wayfinder pipeline put it plainly — "It never did grilling to establish my starting point so it made lots of assumptions of what I already knew." Another reported lessons leaning on undefined jargon, and a lesson tailored to their hardware that covered what the hardware could do while never saying what it couldn't. Two things help: state your prior knowledge and your gaps in the first message, and correct the level out loud when a lesson misses, because the correction becomes a learning record and steers the next one. An explicit knowledge-assessment step is a standing feature request ([#725](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/issues/725)), not shipped behaviour.

**Does it do spaced repetition, and does it know when to stop teaching?**
No to the first, and not reliably to the second. Spacing and interleaving are principles the lessons are designed against, but nothing schedules a review, and there is no Anki or calendar integration — both are recurring requests. The related gap is exit criteria: as one user put it, `teach` "is good at making the next lesson, but not as good at knowing when to stop and switch to review or real practice." If you want review or drilling instead of new material, ask for it; the skill will not propose the switch on its own.

**Is it only useful for code?**
No, and the non-coding use is the larger part of the record: Korean, Japanese formal register, piano, guitar, board game design, OpenSCAD, film plots, Azure and CCNA certifications, university exams, and children of eight and ten getting printable books on escape rooms and fire salamanders. Nothing in the skill is programming-specific — mission, resources, zone of proximal development and drill work the same way in any domain. Within code, the strongest reported use is not learning a language from scratch but getting oriented in an unfamiliar codebase or a new team's stack.

**Which model should I run it with?**
There is no canonical answer, and the reported differences are large. Higher [reasoning effort](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/effort) has been reported to produce noticeably better lessons than the medium setting. One user ran the same skill through Copilot CLI with Codex and got a single thin lesson where Claude Code produced a much fuller one. It runs unmodified in Claude Cowork, subject to whether your organisation allows skills to be added there. If the lessons come out thin, change model, [harness](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/harness) or effort before rewriting your prompt.

## It's working if

- Before its first write, it confirms the teaching root; then it interviews you about why you want this rather than immediately producing a lesson.
- `RESOURCES.md` fills up before the lessons do, and each lesson names one primary source worth reading yourself.
- Claims in a lesson carry links out. A lesson with no citations is the skill teaching from memory.
- A lesson takes one sitting and leaves you able to do one thing you couldn't before.
- Opening a fresh session in the folder and saying "next lesson" continues the course instead of restarting it.
- `learning-records/` grows, and lessons stop re-teaching what you have already demonstrated.
- Reusable material lives in `assets/` rather than being duplicated, and every lesson uses the shared stylesheet.
- A question that needs judgement gets you pointed at a forum, subreddit or class, not just an answer.

## Where it fits

`teach` is a **reach-for-it-anytime standalone**. It is not a step in a build chain and shares no artifacts with the engineering flow; it owns only the teaching directory and lives there for as long as the topic lasts.

Its one real neighbour is [handoff](https://aihero.dev/skills-handoff). If grilling exposes something you first need to learn, do not derail the interview: `/handoff` to a teaching workspace, learn it there with `/teach`, then return and pick up where you left off. The nearby alternative is [research](https://aihero.dev/skills-research), for when what you want is a cited document rather than lessons and retention. When you are not sure which skill or flow fits, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you over the whole set.
